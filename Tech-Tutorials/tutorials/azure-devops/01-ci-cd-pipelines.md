# 01 — CI/CD Pipelines (Azure)

Topics:

- Pipeline structure and YAML basics
- Build, test, publish, and deploy stages
- Secrets management in pipelines
- Using service connections (ARM, ACR)

Exercise ideas:

1. Create a pipeline that builds and pushes a container to ACR.
2. Add a deployment stage that deploys to an App Service or a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Configure pipeline secrets via Azure Key Vault.
