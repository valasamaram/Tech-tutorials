# Tech Tutorials — Azure Interview Preparation

This workspace contains curated tutorials to prepare for Azure Developer, DevOps, and FinOps interviews.

Folder layout:

- `tutorials/azure-developer/` — developer-focused concepts and hands-on tasks
- `tutorials/azure-devops/` — CI/CD, pipelines, IaC and release practices
- `tutorials/azure-finops/` — cost management, governance and FinOps practices

Get started:

1. Open the `tutorials/` folder.
2. Read the `intro.md` files in each track.
3. Add your own lessons as numbered markdown files.

You can customize or convert this into a site later (Docusaurus, MkDocs, etc.).

Enjoy learning — expand these notes as practical labs and sample answers.
