# SQL Learning Path — Basics to Advanced

This folder contains a structured curriculum to learn SQL from first principles through advanced topics and operational skills. Each module is self-contained with explanations, examples, hands-on labs, troubleshooting tips, and interview-style questions.

Structure
- `module_00_sql_basics.md` — Relational model, DDL, basic DML, simple queries.
- `module_01_sql_queries.md` — Advanced SELECT, filtering, sorting, pagination.
- `module_02_joins_subqueries.md` — Joins, cross joins, self joins, subqueries (correlated & non-correlated).
- `module_03_aggregation_window.md` — Aggregates, GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions.
- `module_04_indexing_concurrency.md` — Index types, index design, concurrency basics.
- `module_05_query_optimization.md` — Execution plans, statistics, re-writes, temp objects.
- `module_06_transactions_locking.md` — ACID, isolation levels, MVCC, deadlocks.
- `module_07_security_access.md` — Authentication, authorization, encryption, row-level security.
- `module_08_admin_backup_restore.md` — Backups, PITR, HA options, restore scenarios.
- `module_09_advanced_sql_features.md` — Stored procs, triggers, CTEs, JSON/temporal tables.
- `module_10_capstone_projects.md` — Capstone project ideas, deliverables, grading.
- `cheatsheet.md` — Quick reference for common statements, functions and patterns.

Usage
- Work through modules sequentially.
- For each lab, create a dedicated schema or database in your sandbox to avoid collisions.
- Keep solutions and scripts in a Git repo for review and grading.

If you want, I can also generate SQL sample datasets and runnable scripts to provision them in PostgreSQL / SQL Server / MySQL. Say which engine you prefer.
